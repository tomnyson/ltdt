ou can use git rebase, for example, if you want to modify back to commit bbc643cd, run

$ git rebase --interactive 'bbc643cd^'
In the default editor, modify pick to edit in the line whose commit you want to modify. Make your changes and then commit them with the same message you had before:

$ git commit --all --amend --no-edit
to modify the commit, and after that

$ git rebase --continue
to return back to the previous head commit.

WARNING: Note that this will change the SHA-1 of that commit as well as all children -- in other words, this rewrites the history from that point forward. You can break repos doing this if you push using the command git push --force
